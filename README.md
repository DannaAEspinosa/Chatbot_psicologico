# ü§ñ Psychological Healthcare Chatbot

## üìã Project Overview

This project aims to develop a medium-complexity expert system using Python and the Experta library, coupled with Bayesian networks implemented via the pgmpy library. The primary goal is to provide a chatbot that offers personalized psychological support and guidance, addressing the challenges individuals face in accessing mental health services such as stigma, cost, and resource availability.

## üéØ Objectives

- **OE4.1**: Implement computation with probabilities and understand the Principle of Maximum Entropy.
- **OE4.2**: Develop an expert system utilizing reasoning with Bayesian networks.
- **OE5.1-5.4**: Address the design, development, common errors, and software engineering principles in expert systems.
